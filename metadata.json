    "description": "Pressing 'F4' when Alt+Tab popup is visible closes either the selected window (Alt+'Key above Tab') or all windows of selected app (Alt+Tab). Actually, that is just the default behavior, you have some options.\n\nNotice that some windows may not close when asked (e.g. some may show a 'save changes' dialog), so the extension will activate the window before closing it in order to highlight that.\n\nOBS: not guaranteed to work together with other extensions that also modify Alt Tab popup. Tested only with 'Alt Tab Workspace' and other 'Alt Tab Mod: ...'.",
