Alt Tab Mod: Close Selected Window or App
=========================================

GNOME Shell extension. Supports GNOME Shell 3.6.

Github: https://github.com/dsboger/gs-ext-alttabmod-close-selected

Pressing 'F4' when Alt+Tab popup is visible closes either the selected window (Alt+'Key above Tab') or all windows of selected app (Alt+Tab). Actually, that is just the default behavior, you have some options.

Notice that some windows may not close when asked (e.g. some may show a 'save changes' dialog), so the extension will activate the window before closing it in order to highlight that.

OBS: not guaranteed to work together with other extensions that also modify Alt Tab popup. Tested only with 'Alt Tab Workspace' and other 'Alt Tab Mod: ...'.
